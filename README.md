## 🎯 Why KlinScore?

Clinical scores are essential for evidence-based medicine, but existing solutions have problems:

- **MDCalc**: Requires internet, uses outdated scores, no German localization
- **Paper references**: Slow, error-prone, interrupts workflow
- **Hospital systems**: Often don't include specialty-specific scores

**KlinScore solves this:**

✅ **Offline-first** - Works without internet (hospital WiFi problems? No issue)
✅ **Current guidelines** - ESC 2024, KDIGO 2024, ASA 2020, ACCP 2012
✅ **Bilingual** - German and English throughout
✅ **Fast** - Calculate scores in <30 seconds
✅ **Physician-maintainable** - Add new scores via simple YAML files
✅ **Open source** - Free, auditable, community-driven

## ✨ Features

### 🩺 Multi-Specialty Coverage

- **Cardiology** - Stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VA), bleeding risk (HAS-BLED), ACS risk (GRACE)
- **Nephrology** - Kidney function (eGFR CKD-EPI 2021), progression risk (KFRE)
- **Anesthesiology** - Perioperative risk (ASA, RCRI), OSA screening (STOP-BANG), VTE risk (Caprini)

### 🎨 Modern Interface

- **Three themes** - Light, Dark, and Sepia (reduce eye strain)

- **Real-time calculation** - Instant results as you type
- **Risk visualization** - Color-coded risk levels (green → yellow → red)

### 🌍 German Clinical Standards

- **Metric units** - kg, cm, mmol/L, μmol/L
- **Lab values** - Proper German conversions (Kreatinin, HbA1c, etc.)
- **Terminology** - Medical German throughout (Herzinsuffizienz, Nierenversagen, etc.)
- **Guidelines** - ESC, AWMF, KDIGO (European standards)

### 🔧 Extensibility

## 🧑‍⚕️ For Physicians: Adding New Scores

KlinScore uses simple YAML files to define scores. No programming required!

### Quick Start

1. Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp scores/templates/score_template.yaml scores/cardiology/my_score.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the YAML file with your score details:
   ```yaml
   name: "CHADS2 Score"
   name_de: "CHADS2-Score"
   specialty: Cardiology

   inputs:
     - field: "heart_failure"
       type: "boolean"
       label: "Congestive Heart Failure"
       points: 1
       required: true

   interpretation:
     - score: "0"
       risk: "Low Risk"
       recommendation: "Consider no anticoagulation..."
   ```

3. Restart KlinScore - your score appears automatically!

### YAML Format

See [Score Definition Specification](docs/score_definition_spec.md) for complete documentation.

**Supported input types:**
- `boolean` - Yes/No checkboxes (e.g., "History of stroke")
- `number` - Numeric values with min/max (e.g., "Age: 18-120 years")
- `dropdown` - Multiple choice (e.g., "ASA Class I-VI")

**Conditional points:**
```yaml
points:
  - condition: ">= 65 && < 75"
    points: 1
  - condition: ">= 75"
    points: 2
```

**Risk levels:**
- `VeryLow`, `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`, `VeryHigh`, `Critical`, `None`
- Automatically color-coded in UI
